You are a Data Scientist contracted by the company to build a Recommender System that drives the volume of exchanges and sales among users. However, Book Club does not collect or store the books submitted by users.

The books for exchange are sent by the users themselves through an “Upload” button, they are visible on the site, along with their stars, which represent how much users liked or disliked the book, but Startup does not collect or store it. this data in a database.
